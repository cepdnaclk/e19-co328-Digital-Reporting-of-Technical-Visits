## Introduction

When Engineers or Technicians visit sites to provide technical services (such as repairs, troubleshooting, maintenance), a report should be filled by the visiting service provider and checked off by the service receiver to maintain accountability and transparency. The expectation of this project is to develop a simple, easy to use, robust software application for the above purpose. 
<p align="center"><img align="center" alt="GIF" src="./images/reporting.jpg"></p>

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a simple yet powerful software tool that enables engineers, technicians, and service providers to seamlessly generate detailed reports while on-site, followed by verification and approval from the service recipients. By doing so, we aim to foster accountability, transparency, and open communication between service providers and receivers.

## Software Design

### User Interface for Technicians - Mobile Application

Mobile application mainly consists of;
    
1. Login Page
    * Managing User login with the email and the password.
    * User can choose preffered account for logging.
2. Profile Page
    * User can see the completed, ongoing and missed tasks.
3. Job Cards
    * In assiged task list page, user can see the all information about the task.
    * After doing the task, user can see the job done card.
4. Technician Form
    * User can fill this form instead of using a paper.
    * There is a digital signature ba also.
5. SideBar
    * User can navigate through pages using sidebar.
6. Logout Page

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Our software features an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that enables service providers to quickly enter relevant details during their site visits.

- **Real-time Reporting:** Service providers can create reports in real-time, capturing accurate and up-to-date information directly at the site.

- **Customizable Templates:** Different service scenarios often require different report formats. Our software offers customizable templates to cater to a variety of technical service requirements.

- **Digital Signatures:** The application supports digital signatures for both service providers and receivers, ensuring the authenticity and legal validity of the reports.

- **Approval Workflow:** After generating a report, the software initiates an approval workflow, allowing service receivers to review and either approve or request revisions.

- **Cloud Integration:** Reports are securely stored in the cloud, guaranteeing data accessibility, backup, and retrieval from anywhere at any time.

- **Reporting Analytics:** The software provides valuable insights into service trends, common issues, and time spent on various tasks, aiding organizations in optimizing service operations.

## Why Use Our Software

- **Efficiency:** Our application streamlines the report generation, sharing, and approval processes, saving time for both service providers and receivers.

- **Accountability:** With digital signatures and approval workflows, our software establishes a clear trail of responsibilities, ensuring accountability at every step.

- **Transparency:** Involving service receivers in the approval process fosters transparency and open communication between service providers and clients.

- **Insights:** The built-in analytics offer actionable insights that help organizations enhance service quality and efficiency over time.
